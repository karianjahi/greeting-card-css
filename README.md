# 🎨 CSS Greeting Card with Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements

Welcome to this creative front-end project where I demonstrate my CSS skills by designing an interactive **Greeting Card** using pure HTML and CSS — no JavaScript required!

This project highlights my ability to use advanced **pseudo-classes** and **pseudo-elements** like `::before`, `::after`, `:hover`, `:nth-child()`, and more to create a fun, responsive, and stylish card.
