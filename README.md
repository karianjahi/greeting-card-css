# 🎨 CSS Greeting Card with Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements

Welcome to this creative front-end project where I demonstrate my CSS skills by designing an interactive **Greeting Card** using pure HTML and CSS — no JavaScript required!

This project highlights my ability to use advanced **pseudo-classes** and **pseudo-elements** like `::before`, `::after`, `:hover`, `:nth-child()`, and more to create a fun, responsive, and stylish card.

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes (Author Notes)

This greeting card project was designed as an exercise in using pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. Key ideas that shaped the project:

- `skew()` was used for slanted hover effects

- `::before` and `::after` were used for decorative elements

- `border-radius` for a modern, smooth look

**These techniques demonstrate that compelling UI effects can be achieved with CSS alone, no JavaScript needed.**
